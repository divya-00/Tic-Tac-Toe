# Tic-Tac-Toe Game #

**Description**
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game supports two modes: Computer vs Player and Player vs Player. Players can make their moves and try to win by getting three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

**How to Play**
* Run the script in a Python environment.
* Choose the game mode:
  - Computer vs Player: The computer will play against you.
  - Player vs Player: Two players take turns making their moves.
* Follow the on-screen instructions to input your moves.
* The game will continue until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

**Game Rules**
The game board is a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on empty spaces.
A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
